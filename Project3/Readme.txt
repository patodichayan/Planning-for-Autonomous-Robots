To run the program , just start ChayanKumarPatodi_Project3.py file and it would start the simulation as well. 
I have written a script inside the python code to start the simulation. 

Also i have set the position of the bot using start co-ordinates which would be the user input for the python file.
I have done the simulation in Vrep.
The simulation works , but it isn't proper. The bot may reach near to the goal points for a certain
set of parameters and may be completely different for another.Also the problem right now is because 
of the orientation of the bot .
Once you set the orientation of the bot , the simulation should work fine.

The python file plots the path of the robot in a very optimal runtime , which starts the simulation
once you close the plot figure.

I am using the LUA script provided in the canvas files section for the turtle bot.

Video 2 and Video 3 shows it tries to reach the goal node.
